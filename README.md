# Chulalongkorn University's AI Academy 2020
## 2nd round screening exam

---
This exam intends to mimic a real project situation where you have to clean the data yourself and validate your modelâ€™s performance without relying on specified test sets as in normal Kaggle competitions.

Your work will be evaluated on multiple criteria. The final model performance is NOT the most important consideration, but we rather want to see how you approach the tasks and justify design choices made along the way.

You are not expected to understand the meaning of all features. In fact, the names of many features have been anonymized to prevent examinees with domain knowledge from getting advantage over others.

This exam consists of 3 problems, each testing you on different aspects of data analysis and machine learning model development. Given the short amount of time, we DO NOT expect you to complete or even attempt all 3 problems. 

### Plan your time wisely and show us what you can do!

## **Problem 3: The Tale of Two Wat**

For this problem, you are tasked to develop a machine learning model that takes a photo as input and classify whether that photo contains Wat Prakaew or Wat Po. Gather your dataset from photos on the internet. [Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mdZLeiG0NSR6idRFCs9k_1GAsJ59riDK) are some photos that we expect your model to be able to correctly classify
